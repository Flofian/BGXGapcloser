# BGXGapcloser

This is inteded to replace the antigapcloser handling that is already included in the sdk, since some stuff in the sdk is broken/missing, and it wasnt possible to get the spell name, so you couldn't create a white/blacklist

The entire thing should be self explanatory, if you set the debug flag to true, it will include ally gapclosers

To use, check out the minimal example
